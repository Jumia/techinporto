# How to contribute

We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute with new posts or code changes.
There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on
top of things.

## Add a new post

The easiest way to propose a new post is by [open a new github issue](https://github.com/JumiaGroup/techblog/issues/new).
Make sure that you set the label "blog-content" in your issue.
Use [post template](POST_TEMPLATE.md) as issue content.

If you have a technicall background you may add your own post (and other posts):

* fork the repository
* add your post file on _post/ folder
* Make a pull request to this repo (check PULL_REQUEST.md)

Please [open a new github issue](https://github.com/JumiaGroup/techblog/issues/new) for further support.

## Request a new feature

Use [ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) as reference.
