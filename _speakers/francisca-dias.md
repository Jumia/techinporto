talk: How to predict tags in Stack Overflow questions using Keras
description:
    Through the public Stack Overflow dataset, I will predict the topic/label for each given Stack Overflow question.
    There are 20 labels such as c#, python, css, javascript, androind, iphone, ios, etc, and there are 40.000 questions. 
    I will split the data into train and test.
    Using Keras, a python deep learning library, I will process the text from both questions and labels. Once the text has been converted to a format Keras can read, I will apply the model.
    I will then make predictions on test data. I can also ask audience to come up with new questions and ask the model what it predicts.
