bio:
    "I'm a software developer for 6 years now and been always dealing with back-end and infrastructure topics. As a software engineer I'm ultra enthusiastic about event-driven architectures and its related topics and software design in general.
    For the past years I've been active member of the PHP SP community (PHP São Paulo user group), as part of the organization and recurrently as speaker at conferences.
    My main interests are education, software design, distributed systems and event-driven architectures."
