talk: Cloud Edge Computing
description:
    "Current web application architectures have code running on two places: on an end user's device (computer, phone, wearable) and on a backend server. Server software can be updated quickly whereas end user software lags. At the same time end user software has very low latency, whereas servers are often located 100s of ms from the end user. A different architecture pushes code into a global network. Code pushed in this way can have fast update times (since it doesn't require updating an end user device) while being at low latency from the end user. Cloudflare's Workers are an example that use rapidly updateable JavaScript deployed across its 151 PoPs around the world. This talk will look at the architecture of Workers and specific use cases."
