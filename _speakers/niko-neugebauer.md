talk: Fast Calculations with Big Amounts of Data (on the Good Old Relational Platform)
description:
    "I want to show how some of the most useful calculations can be done with extreme effectiveness without munching data on the BigData platforms.
    I will kick off with a couple of million rows scenarios, going well into the billions and maybe even more. :)
    Executing some basic calculations is super-easy, but I want to get to the point where I can show the power of the Batch Execution Mode processing and how one can process scenarios with reasonable complexity without leaving a relational database."
